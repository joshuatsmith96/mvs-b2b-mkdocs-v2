# Re-Usable Components

This is a list of useful components that can be used on CMC. This list contains the HTML structures needed to call each component.

## JotForm Component

Used to populate JotForms. Instead of calling an embed script, you can use the following html tag with element set to "JotForm", and the id for the form in the props attribute.

```
<div element="JotForm" props="{'id': 'id_here'}"></div>
```
